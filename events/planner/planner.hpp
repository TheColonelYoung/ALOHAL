 * @brief   Serve as support struture during handeling of complicated procedures with dependencies
 *          Planner constains of phases. Each phase has triggers and consequences.
 *              Triggers serves as starting condition. All triggers must be fullfilled Before another phase starts.
 *              Consequencies are function which will be starting at start fof phase.
 *          Special case is phase 0 and last phase.
 *              Zero phase has no triggers and last phase has no consequencies.
 *              Last phase is determinated as phase -1;
 *          Planner contains IRQ handler. IRQ is invocated after last phase is done.
 *          Planner cannot start when is no atleast one trigger and one consequence for every phase (excluding phase 0 and -1)
