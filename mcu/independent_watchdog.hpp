 * @brief   Watchdog is capable to reset mcu when is not periodically reset

 *          Contains downcounting register, when this register reach zero, mcu is reset
 *          Also contains windows register, when counter is above value in window register and watchdog
 *              is reset, reset is considered as invalid and mcu is immediately reset
 *          Watchdog is disabled in debug mode by default.
