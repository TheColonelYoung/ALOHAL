/*
Some modifications of HAL USb middleware layer are needed for proper function

Add this to usbd_cdc_if.h (anywhere to begining of file where this will not be rewritten)):
extern void USB_VCP_RX_Callback(uint8_t* Buf, uint32_t Len);
extern void USB_VCP_TX_Callback();

Add this to usbd_cdc_if.c -> CDC_Receive_FS (around line 260) as first line of function:
USB_VCP_RX_Callback(Buf, *Len);

Add this to usbd_cdc_if.c -> CDC_TransmitCplt_FS (around line 310) as first line of function:
USB_VCP_TX_Callback();
