 * @brief   Tasker serves for execution of low priority events with low frequency (mostly below 10 Hz)
 *          Precision of Tasker is not good (up to miliseconds), because can contain more event planned to same time
 *          Example usage of Tasker is to execute LED toggle every 500ms
 *          Tasker can also be used to delay some event (creating event with one repetition)
 *          The is no mechanism for paralel safety between events and normal program
